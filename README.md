# NGOSTI (Next Generation Security Operator Training Infrastructure)

The NGSOTI project is dedicated to training the next generation of Security Operation Center (SOC) operators, focusing on the human aspect of cybersecurity. It underscores the significance of providing SOC operators with the necessary skills and open-source tools to address challenges such as detection engineering, incident response, and threat intelligence analysis. Involving key partners such as CIRCL, Restena, Tenzir, and the University of Luxembourg, the project aims to establish a real operational infrastructure for practical training. This initiative integrates academic curricula with industry insights, offering hands-on experience in cyber ranges.

## Projects

- [vulnerability-lookup](https://github.com/cve-search/vulnerability-lookup) Vulnerability-Lookup facilitates quick correlation of vulnerabilities from various sources, independent of vulnerability IDs, and streamlines the management of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD).
- [poppy](https://www.misp-project.org/2024/03/25/Poppy-a-new-bloom-filter-format-and-project.html/) Poppy is a Rust crate offering an efficient implementation of Bloom filters. It also includes a command-line utility (also called poppy) allowing users to effortlessly create filters with their desired capacity and false positive probability. Values can be added to the filters via standard input, facilitating the use of this tool in a pipeline workflow.
- [kunai](https://github.com/kunai-project/kunai) Kunai is a powerful tool designed to bring actionable insights for tasks such as security monitoring and threat hunting on Linux systems. Think of it as the Linux counterpart to Sysmon on Windows, tailored for comprehensive and precise event monitoring.
- [SkillAegis](https://github.com/MISP/SkillAegis)  SkillAegis is a platform to design, run, and monitor exercise scenarios, enhancing skills in applications like MISP and training users in best practices for information management and protective tools. Its gamification system makes learning engaging, ensuring users acquire essential technical skills and adhere to industry standards.
